# CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE
### (Web Application and Exploratory Data Analysis)

Project Website Link available [here](https://josephmani.github.io/ConfrontingClimateChange/)

## Abstract:

* This Web Application intends to spread awareness on Climate Change's impacts using the concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Statistical Regression Models and Graphs.

* It aims to emphasize abstract concepts like climate change, analyzing the levels of Carbon Dioxide and greenhouse gas emission data over the last few decades.

* Ultimately, our web app will help people understand the severity of this Global Issue.


## Technical Details:

This Web App uses a responsive design with the UI consisting of a slide showcase MENU with the following tabs:

*	HOME: Displays the Homepage.

*	EARTH-NOW: This tab directs the user to NASA's Earth Now website that monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air, and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns.

*	FAQ: Demystifies common questions and misconceptions that people may have about climate change and its impacts.

*	REFERENCES: Displays the websites of organizations aiming to combat climate change by spreading awareness. These sites are great for educational content and understanding the various implications in the long-term of climate change. 

*	DONATE: Redirects the user to environment-focused organizations where your donation goes furthest, including its Charity Navigator score, which breaks down how organizations use donations and how transparent they are about it.

### a.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
*	Inspired by other open-source projects that aim to explore and draw conclusions based on present data available on Global CO2 emission levels.

*	CO2 emission data of various countries were taken and compiled into a data set for easy analysis. Seasonal adjustments were made to reduce the variables to just human intervention.

* Applied statistical prediction models to give an insight of the future CO2 amounts (in ppm) present in the atmosphere if the present scenario continues.

### b.	Socials:
*	Facebook: Activist Group that posts relevant news and pictures regarding any aspect of the climate and is open to discussing any topic pertinent to climate past, present, and future. 

*	Twitter: Account of Greta Thunberg, an 18 year old climate and environmental activist.

*	Instagram: Official Instagram account of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat.

## Fabrication:
*	For the Web Application: HTML5, CSS.
*	For the EDA: Google Collab to host the Jupyter notebook.
*	tools used: python, pandas, mathplotlib.
