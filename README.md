Abstract:
This Web Application intends to spread awareness on Climate Change's impacts using the concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Statistical Regression Models and Graphs.

It aims to emphasize abstract concepts like climate change, analyzing the levels of Carbon Dioxide and greenhouse gas emission data over the last few decades.
Ultimately, our web app will help people understand the severity of this Global Issue.


Introduction:
This report will outline the Web App design and the EDA prediction of CO2 emission levels and temperature changes all over the world.






Technical Details:
Our Web App uses a responsive design with the UI consisting of a slide showcase MENU with the following tabs:

•	HOME: Displays the Homepage.

•	EARTH-NOW: This tab directs the user to NASA's Earth Now website that monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air, and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns.

•	FAQ: Demystifies common questions and misconceptions that people may have about climate change and its impacts.

•	REFERENCES: Displays the websites of organizations aiming to combat climate change by spreading awareness. These sites are great for educational content and understanding the various implications in the long-term of climate change. 

•	DONATE: Redirects the user to environment-focused organizations where your donation goes furthest, including its Charity Navigator score, which breaks down how organizations use donations and how transparent they are about it.

a.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Inspired by other open-source projects that aim to explore and draw conclusions based on present data available on Global CO2 emission levels.

•	CO2 emission data of various countries were taken and compiled into a data set for easy analysis. Seasonal adjustments were made to reduce the variables to just human intervention.

•	 Applied statistical prediction models to give an insight of the future CO2 amounts (in ppm) present in the atmosphere if the present scenario continues.

•	Dark Fact: The maximum amount of CO2 levels in the atmosphere where life is capable of existence is 5000 ppm. With this pollution rate, we can approximate the d-day prediction that might occur in the year 4300.

b.	Socials:
•	Facebook: Activist Group that posts relevant news and pictures regarding any aspect of the climate and is open to discussing any topic pertinent to climate past, present, and future. 




•	Twitter: Account of Greta Thunberg, an 18 year old climate and environmental activist.

•	Instagram: Official Instagram account of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat.

Fabrication:
•	For the Web Application: HTML5, CSS.

•	For the EDA: Google Collab to host the Jupyter notebook.
•	tools used: python, pandas, mathplotlib.
